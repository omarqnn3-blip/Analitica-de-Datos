I had a fantastic time in Budapest. I loved the city and to have the privilege be here in the heart of Pest, so close to all the highlights, in your wonderful apartment. It was great to go around and discover the town and all its covers. When the day is over it was great to be in such a welcoming place, so spacious and tastefully decorated. How wonderful to be able to navigate in INTERNET, also to walk to Womai areme and find a 24 H opened supermarket.

I shall be very happy to come back one day. In the meantime, Thank you for your welcome.

Aron has been hosting guests at his own apartment through Airbnb since 2013, and starting from 2014, he has also been managing other apartments as well. Eva joined him in 2015, and they have since been working on ways to make guests' trips to Budapest unforgettable.

We were both born and raised in Budapest and know the city like the back of our hands. We love welcoming travellers and showing them what this beautiful place has to offer. We do our best to welcome all guests in person or send a friend when neither of us can make it to make sure you are in good hands. We are happy to answer all your questions and give you recommendations on where to go and what to see!

On a more personal note, Aron loves sports, especially hockey and badminton, and tries to live an active life, also using his bike as everyday transport in the city. The most important things in his life are his little son and daughter, who are keeping them busy and giving them a life full of joy.

Eva's personal interests include community building and volunteering, and she hopes to help making this world a better place through education and charity work. She also translates and organises community events, and is admittedly an Anglophile and very fond of Shakespeare. She also sings in a band along with her dad!

We both love travelling and meeting new people, and we believe that Airbnb grants a unique opportunity to do both.
